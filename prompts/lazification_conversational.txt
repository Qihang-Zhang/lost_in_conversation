You are given a segment of a fully specified instruction, and your task is to: (1) choose one that will be the initial query of a multi-step query, and then each of the remaining segment should be one int provided to the system in a follow-up turn of the conversation.

Your output should be a JSON object in the following format:
{
    "initial_segment": "[exact excerpt from the instruction]",
    "initial_query": "conversational version of the initial segment",
    "hints": [
    {"segment": "[exact excerpt from the instruction]", "hint": "conversational version of the segment taking the rest of the instruction into account"}
    ]
}

Example:

Full Query:
What are the names and locations of the stadiums that had concerts that occurred in both 2014 and 2015?

Segments:
[
    {"segment": "names and locations", "is_required": 1},
    {"segment": "stadiums", "is_required": 1},
    {"segment": "concerts", "is_required": 1},
    {"segment": "in both 2014", "is_required": 1},
    {"segment": "and 2015", "is_required": 1}
]

Output:
{
    "initial_segment": "stadiums",
    "initial_query": "popular stadiums",
    "hints": [
        {"segment": "concerts", "hint": "the stadiums should have concerts during a period"},
        {"segment": "in both 2014", "hint": "the concerts should have occurred in 2014 in the stadiums"},
        {"segment": "and 2015", "hint": "the concerts should have also occurred in 2015 in the same stadiums"},
        {"segment": "names and locations", "hint": "for the stadiums, returned both the name and location"}
    ]
}

Rules:
- [Transform each segment] Make sure each segment is included either as the initial query or as a hint. Do not forget any segments.
- [Short initial query] Make the initial query short, not a full sentence, similar to how users use a search engine like Google.
- [Order of hints] Order the hints in order of importance, from most to least important to the query. You do not need to keep the order the segments are provided in.

Now complete the task for the following fully specified query and segments:

Fully Specified Query:
[[QUERY]]

Segments:
[[SEGMENTS]]
